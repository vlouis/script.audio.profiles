# script.audio.profiles
Save audio profile and easily switch between them

forked from Regss/script.audio.profiles

Try to add "learn" switch to settings

I think most of people using this addon to change the sound output between only two outputs.
In my case between HDMI and USB. I want to switch the output using android remote app,
but running the addon will enter in config save mode... I want to modify to be able to disable 
the config save mode in settings, and when disabled running the addon to toggle the output.
